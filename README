The 3 uploaded images show you what your Cheat Engine settings should look like.
This will prevent detection as much as possible, whether you're using nopde, check cashed, or
some other cheat engine.

If you want to use my personal bypasses cheat engine, please download the original
from the cheat engine website (version 7.1), and then drag CeleryEngine.exe into the
cheat engine folder and run that.

It's my own cheat engine, blanketed to be undetected by ROBLOX.
