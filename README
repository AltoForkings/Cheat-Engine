The 3 uploaded images show you what your Cheat Engine (CE) settings should look like to prevent detection.

Here's how to use my bypassed CE (CeleryEngine.exe):
Download Cheat Engine 7.1
Drag CeleryEngine.exe into the installed CE folder, where the
original Cheat Engine.exe is.
Run CeleryEngine.exe instead.

There are 3 images uploaded (jpg's) in this github.
MAKE SURE that your cheat engine settings look as closely as
possible to them, to reduce detection.
