The pictures I uploaded are to show what your Cheat Engine settings should look like
to prevent detection as best as possible, whether you're using nopde, check cashed, or
some other cheat engine.
This is HIGHLY IMPORTANT /\ /\ /\



HOW TO USE:

Press Ctrl+Alt+L, or in Cheat Engine's menu, select Table --> Show Cheat Table Lua Script.

Paste EVERYTHING from script_executor.lua into the field.

Hit Execute script.

If it loads up, you will see in the Dev Console output
a message saying "loaded"
NOW, you can execute lua scripts in your chat bar like so:

c/print("hello, world!");

c/game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character.Head:Destroy()


These are examples.

If you need a bypassed version of Cheat Engine to run this, consider Check Cashed or NOPDE.
I use a re-compiled version.
