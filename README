Press Ctrl+Alt+L, or in Cheat Engine's menu, select Table --> Show Cheat Table Lua Script.

Paste everything from script_executor.lua into the field.

Hit Execute script.

It will then load up, and now you can execute lua scripts in your chat bar LIKE SO:

c/print("hello, world!");

c/game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character.Head:Destroy()


These are examples.

If you need a bypassed version of Cheat Engine to run this, consider Check Cashed, and
if you really can't find one, DM me at Threaded#5538
